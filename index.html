				<h2>Snow!</h2>
				<p>
					Yay! I've loved the snow days we've gotten - it's amazing to enjoy the snow. It's crazy to think of how unique
					Earth is to have liquid water paired with an atmosphere that can actually produce snow. This week, I was able
					to spend a lot of time on Quantum Computing and am just constantly amazed - I learned Grover's algorithm and
					was so shaken by the entire process. Through clever rotations, we can actually manipulate qubits to amplify
					the probabilities of desired keys. It seems hard to believe, but the math works out. Could this be my calling?

				<h2>Growth</h2>
				<p>
					I met with my therapist recently and realized how much utility therapy has given - it is immensely useful to
					have
					an objective listener that provides both clinical advice and challenging assertions to break feedback loops
					(like
					mini-CBT). Really, we worked together to identify that grief might be spilling into other areas of my life,
					increasing irritability while simultaneously giving me another perspective on different aspects of my life. I
					hope
					to work towards our goals + self-empathy, something I personally struggle with.

				<h2>Recovery</h2>
				<p>
					I don't have much to say, but I do think this week has focused on adjusting back to the normal pace of life. I
					went to his funeral and I am slowly finding closure. I really hope that this experience helps me identify the
					people I really enjoy spending time with and makes me spend more time with them.

				<h2>A Terrible Loss</h2>
				<p>
					* This will be a long post *

					Yesterday, I found out that my friend committed suicide by jumping out of his room at Terry Hall. I am still
					in
					shock - we shared math together and had hung out before. He was the most positive person I know - he loved to
					listen to music. He loved smash and just was always so... enthusiastic. We had a playlist together, so I think
					I
					will continue to add to it and listen to his songs. I just - I just don't know why he would do this. He was
					smart,
					handsome, capable, and well liked. His second quarter was off to a good start, this is the beginning of the
					three.
					More than anything, I'm confused. He deserved better.

					However, especially when bad happens, we must take time to reflect on the lessons it teaches us. More than
					anything, his death imparts the importance of remembering that life is 1% what happens to us and 99% of how we
					react. His death is terrible - that is 1%. The question now is: How do we react? How do I continue his memory
					and
					continue to propagate good? What is the 99% that I can do to continue my mission of empowering everyone to
					achieve
					more?

					Do I regret his death? Absolutely. Do I blame it on myself? A little - I just wish he knew how much I liked
					him.

					What does this teach me? Well, it encourages me to redouble personal efforts to treat everyone with love and
					kindness. And, it also reminds me that the friendships that I deem worthwile should be reinvested in, while
					ones
					that perform poorly should be mercilessly and swiftly divested. This does not mean treating the other person
					pettily - rather, ensuring that interactions with them have limited costs.

					Rest in peace. I'll still listen to our playlist - maybe even add to it. I hope you can hear it.

				<h2>Back to school</h2>
				<p>
					We're back! I'm grateful to be back after a long break...I think 3 weeks is honestly a bit too much! I love my
					three day weekends. OVer break, I was lucky to travel with my parents to Antarctica! It was an amazing
					experience
					- I loved learning about the complex antarctic ecosystem and how human tourism is actually impacting the area.
					In
					fact, tourists actually cause penguins to have to reroute while reaching their nests, causing the penguins to
					deplete their precious supply of energy (likely stored in blubber). I even met a tour guide with a PhD in
					Antarctic tourism! Overall, it was an amazing experience to reflect on the diversity of our world +
					contemplate
					how CS can be applied beyond the traditional fields it is considered in.

				<h2>Tranquility</h2>
				<p>Being at college has given me an opportunity to really enjoy some alone time - to ponder what I'd like to do
					with my life, to understand what makes me happy, to reflect on my objectives for university. I went to the tea
					garden (alone) hoping for inspiration. The morning was frigid, yet the trees stood stoically and resiliently.
					I'd
					like to say that I had sudden realizations, but I didn't - simply put, going to the tea garden imparted
					tranquility, but it did not give a meaning to life. I suspect that finding my purpose will take many years of
					trial and error - and I'm ready for it.

				<h2>Honors 100 Reflection</h2>
				<p>You can download my reflection <b><a href="/honors/docs/181125Kang.pdf">here</a></b>. The image is of a snowy
					landscape
					(love them!) I wish Seattle had more hard precipitation, but I will happily accept the rain. :)</p>

				<h2>Academic Performance</h2>
				<p>My midterms have all gone well, but I recognized that this was only because my learning style is dependent
					upon
					sharing my knowledge with others: in essence, I learn best by teaching. This is extremely applicable for the
					rest
					of college - I should constantly seek to develop "lesson plans" to teach learned material and subconsciously
					reinforce the learned principles. Moreover, it allows me to continue serving others by sharing knowledge. (The
					image is from my math midterm - got a perfect!)</p>

				<h2>The Importance of Violin</h2>
				<p>Independently pursuing violin has really fueled metacognitive analysis. I ask myself, "Why do I like to play
					violin?" and "Does it make me happy?" After reflecting, I realized the violin is deeply embedded in my
					identity
					and that my love for music is a fundamental aspect of who I am. UW has emboldened my tenacity when playing
					violin
					and strengthened my love for music. (The image is of the piece I am currently working on - Praeludium and
					Allegro
					by Kriesler).</p>

				<h2>Setting a Routine</h2>
				<p>Oh, the many hours of a day! Now that I have much greater control over my schedule, I recognize how many
					hours
					each day holds - so much time to study (or relax), make friends, and just enjoy the beautiful campus. My
					calendar
					is slowly filling up with events + I'm lucky to have recurring extracurriculars like the CSE Student Advisory
					Council. The freedom of my schedule really enforces my sentiment that time must be carefully managed to
					increase
					productivity while still allowing spontaneity and fun!</p>
